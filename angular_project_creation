Hi Murali ,

Iam working in IHG project since (05/06/2019) request you to release me from the project.

I’m glad to be a part of IHG in which I get a chance to work in the web support team, but now I’d like to work in another project,
which has a lot of scope exclusively for development in Angular 6+, React js, Business Intelligence applications & the new technology (Node js) projects.

As my interest lies in FullStack development project, I’d like to work in the development project where there is more scope for Angular 6+ with Node Js development 
project. This would not only give me self-satisfaction but also help me to build a very strong career in TCS.

Also, I travel almost for 2 hrs from my home (Ambattur) to office, so I would like to move into a project which is operated from facilities near to my home, 
which would help me in reducing the travel time.

Hence, I kindly request you to consider my request and do the needful at the earliest. Hoping to hear from you soon.





This mail is a urgent and humble request for release me from my current project(IHG).

I’m glad to be a part of IHG in which I get a chance to work in the web support team, now I’d like to relocate another location. As my newly wedded wife’s work location
is Hyderabad, we are unable to lead a peaceful life apart from each other. This is badly affecting my work life balance that prevents me from giving my full potential 
towards the current project. So I would like to move into Hyderabad location,which would help me to build a very strong career in TCS.

Hence, I kindly request you to consider my request and Please do the needful asap. Awaiting a positive and immediate response. Thank you.

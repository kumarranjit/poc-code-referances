Typescript
=============
Typescript vs ECMAScript
-------------------------
TypeScript syntax is a superset of JavaScript(Ecmascript).

TypeScript is just an extension of the standard ECMAScript 6 syntax

TypeScript is very similar Flow, dart and coffeescript that focus on the same problem.

TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

ES6 is a version of ECMAScript (ES), which is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMA international.

TypeScript supports all primitive data types ( String, Number, Boolean, Array, Enum, Tuple, generics) . 
Major advantage of TypeScript is that it helps to build class-based objects.

Both TypeScript and ES6 are supports Modules, Class, Blocked Scope, Template Literals, Generators, Optional Parameters , 
Default Parameters, Rest Parameters, De-structuring Assignment, Symbols, Closure, decorators and Latest Iterators.

TypeScript only support features are generics and type annotations, Interfaces, Enums, Readonly properties and Mixin

Typescript is an extension of ES6. Some features that are additionally included in Typescript are:

1. Type Annotations 
	eg: name: String = ‘xyz’
	number: Number = ‘123’;
2. Interfaces
3. Enums
4. Mixins

What does @Component decorator exactly do?
---------------------------------------------
Component decorator allows you to mark a class as an Angular component and provide additional metadata that determines how the component should be processed, 
instantiated and used at runtime.

var len=1000;
var arr= new Array(1000);
console.time("time1");
for(var i=0; i<len; i++){
console.log(arr[i]);}
console.timeEnd("time1");

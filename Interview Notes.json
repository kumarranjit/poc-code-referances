Typescript
=============
Typescript vs ECMAScript
-------------------------
TypeScript syntax is a superset of JavaScript(Ecmascript).

TypeScript is just an extension of the standard ECMAScript 6 syntax

TypeScript is very similar Flow, dart and coffeescript that focus on the same problem.

TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

ES6 is a version of ECMAScript (ES), which is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMA international.

TypeScript supports all primitive data types ( String, Number, Boolean, Array, Enum, Tuple, generics) . 
Major advantage of TypeScript is that it helps to build class-based objects.

Both TypeScript and ES6 are supports Modules, Class, Blocked Scope, Template Literals, Generators, Optional Parameters , 
Default Parameters, Rest Parameters, De-structuring Assignment, Symbols, Closure, decorators and Latest Iterators.

TypeScript only support features are generics and type annotations, Interfaces, Enums, Readonly properties and Mixin

Typescript is an extension of ES6. Some features that are additionally included in Typescript are:

1. Type Annotations 
	eg: name: String = ‘xyz’
	number: Number = ‘123’;
2. Interfaces
3. Enums
4. Mixins

What does @Component decorator exactly do?
---------------------------------------------
Component decorator allows you to mark a class as an Angular component and provide additional metadata that determines how the component should be processed, 
instantiated and used at runtime.


Roles and Responsibilities:

Make design and technical decisions for AngularJS projects

Delivering a complete front end application
Coordinating the workflow between the graphic designer, the HTML coder, and yourself
Cooperating with the back-end developer in the process of building the RESTful API
Communicating with external web services

Creating self-contained, reusable, and testable modules and components
Ensuring a clear dependency chain, in regard to the app logic as well as the file system
Validating user actions on the client side and providing responsive feedback

====================================================================
1. out of given 3 arrays with n number of elements, find out the common element(s) for all 3 arrays.
 
2. from a given array, make n elements rotate.
eg. given Array:[21,54,11,35,4,18], index:3; output Array: [4,18,21,54,11,35]
 
3. from an array, find out the elements, and their repetition and print as element=count.
eg. 
input Array: [2,1,3,4,6,5,4,7,5,6,8,2,3,6,2,6,4,4,7,3,4,5,6]
output: 
2=3
1=1
3=3
4=5
6=5
5=5
7=2
8=1

Q4. Given a sorted array with the duplicates, move all the distinct elements to the front. 
arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6] 

output: 
arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..........]

Q5. Given a sorted array and a key, find the two numbers which sum to the given key. 
arr = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8] 
key = 10 

output: 3 7 

Q6. What will be the output?

a()
b()

function a() {
console.log(‘This is function a’);
}

var b = function() {
console.log(‘This is function b’);
}
   

7- Prime number program
9-Q14. Print the right diagonal of the matrix
Input:
1    2    3    4 
5    6    7    8
9   10    11  12
13  14    15  16

Output:
4  7  10  13


function rightDiagonal(a,row,column){
    for (let i=0;i<row;i++){
        for(let j=0;j<column; j++){
            if(i+j == column-1){
                console.log(a[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}



Q15. What will be the output?

console.log(‘Good Morning’);

Ans
Good Morning
Good Afternoon
Hello, World!


Q16. What will be the output?

a()
b()

function a() {
    console.log(‘This is function a’);
}

var b = function() {
    console.log(‘This is function b’);
}

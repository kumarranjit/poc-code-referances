Hi Murali,

Iam working in IHG project since (05/06/2019) request you to release me from the project.

I’m glad to have been a part of IHG in which I got a chance to work in the web support team, but now I’d like to work in another project 
which has a lot of scope exclusively for development in (Angular 6+, React js) Business Intelligence & (Node js projects) the upcoming new technology,

As my interest lies in FullStack development project, I’d like to work in the development project where there is more scope for Angular 6+ with Node Js development 
project. This would not only give me self-satisfaction but also help me to build a very strong career in TCS.

Also, I travel almost for 2 hrs to from my home in (HOME AREA) to office in (OFFICE AREA),so I was thinking of getting into a project which is operated from facilities near to my home, which would help me in reducing the time I invest in traveling.

I kindly request you to consider my request and do the needful at the earliest.
